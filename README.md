Modified script to define a cluster in DSE OpsCenter LCM
===

1. Define cluster topology and configuration in `config/config.yaml`. An example has been provided in `config/sample_config.yaml`
2. Install python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run script: `python main.py`

Optionally, specify a config file to use: `main.py -f config/sample_config.yaml`

# dse-opscenter-api-examples
Working with the DataStax OpsCenter LCM (Lifecycle Manager) API is actually really simple. The location of the LCM API documentation can be found here: https://docs.datastax.com/en/opscenter/6.7/api/docs/lcm_overview.html

Likewise, I have also created some quick examples that you can use here.

# easiest API call
To do the easiest API call, go to http://IP-address-of-OpsCenter:8888/api/v2/lcm/datacenters
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinbreese/dse-opscenter-api-examples/master/results.jpg)
* You will notice that this will output a ton of stuff on the datacenters within your cluster
* Congrats, you just did your first API call! This was basically a `GET` request into LCM via the API

# Start to finish: create a cluster
Let's do all of the steps necessary to create a running cluster by only using the API. There is a specific order of operations that we need to do in order to setup a cluster. They are:
* Create a repo
* Create the credentials
* Create a configuration profile
* Create a cluster
* Assign a datacenter to the cluster
* Assign nodes to the datacenter
* Run an install job
* Listen to the install job status (optional)

Follow along as we step through this journey!

## Create your infrastructure
* Create your single OpsCenter node by looking at this link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/opscenter/6.1/opsc/install/opscInstallDeb_t.html or use Docker!
* Make sure that OpsCenter is up and running: `sudo service opscenterd status`
* Create at least one VM that will act as your cluster. Of course you can have as many VMs as you wish here; to represent multiple datacenters, etc.

## create-repo.py
Create a repo that you want the nodes to download DSE from. You can pass your DataStax Academy credentials for this example into the code.
* Be sure to change out the following variables for your environment: `server_ip`, `username`, `password`, and `repo_desc`
* Output: the `repository_id` is outputted by this script, you will need it for future steps!

## create-credentials.py
In order for LCM to interact with the VMs, you will need to give LCM the proper credentials (e.g. SSH, username, password, etc.) to do so
* Be sure to change out the following variables for your environment: `server_ip`, `creds_name`, `username`, and `privateKey`
* Output: the `machine_credential_id` is outputted by this script, you will need it for future steps!

## create-config_profile.py
Do you want to stop editing YAML files? If so, you need to learn how to use configuration profiles
* Configuration profiles a group of defined settings that you can assign to a given cluster, DCs, and/or nodes
* Instead of modifying individual YAML files (dse.yaml, cassandra.yaml, etc.), you can create a single configuration profile and assign it to many nodes, DCs, or clusters
* Be sure to change out the following variables for your environment: `server_ip` and `cluster_name`
* You can specify further configurations that you wish to make to the `cassandra.yaml` and `dse.yaml` JSON properties
* Output: the `cluster_profile_id` is outputted by this script, you will need it for future steps!

## create-cluster.py
Now we can start defining the cluster. To do that, you'll need to bring in the IDs from the previous steps (e.g. `repository_id`, `machine_credential_id`, and `cluster_profile_id`)
* Be sure to change out the following variables for your environment: `server_ip`, `cluster_name`, `repository_id`, `machine_credential_id`, `cassandra_default_password`, and `cluster_profile_id`
* Output: the `cluster_id` is outputted by this script, you will need it for future steps!

## create-datacenter.py
Now that the cluster has been setup, you now have to  at least one datacenter.
* You'll need the `cluster_id` from the previous step
* Be sure to change out the following variables for your environment: `server_ip`, `data_center`, and `cluster_id`
* Output: the `dc_id` that you will use in the next step

## create-nodes.py
In this step, we will assign the node(s) to the appropriate datacenter.
* You'll need the `dc_id` from the previous step
* Be sure to change out the following variables for your environment: `server_ip`, `dc_id`, `node_name`, `private_ip`, and ` node_ip`

## run-job.py
Now that you have configured the cluster, datacenter, and node(s), you have to run a job in order to install everything.
* You'll need the cluster_id from the `create-cluster.py` script
* Be sure to modify the `server_ip`, `job-type`, `resource_id` and the `scope` as needed for the job that you are trying to do.
* Output: the `job_id` that you will use in the next step (optional)

## job-listener.py
Within OpsCenter LCM, you submit a job, but you want to see if it is finished or if it failed. That is what this code does.
* Fill out the `server_ip` and `job_id` variables for what you are listening for

# Bonus Section: but wait, there's more!
You have now created a cluster from scratch with the API, congrats! If you choose, here are some bonus examples.

## enable-nodesync.py
This is a quick example on how to enable nodesync on specific keyspaces and/or tables.
* Nodesync is a new feature that can be found in DataStax Enterprise 6.0 and newer.
* It helps alleviate the operation burden of having to manage `nodetool repair` and `nodetool rebuild` throughout your cluster.
* It makes sure that these type of anti-entropy operations are consisently happening in the background. The impact to your cluster performance that has nodesync enabled is very minimal.
* By default, nodesync is not enabled (currently) and you have to enable it per each table

In the example, I list out a group of tables to enable nodesync on. You should see the format: `OpsCenter.*`
* That is enabling nodesync on the entire `OpsCenter` keyspace due to the use of `.*`
* If I wanted to enable nodesync on only a specific table named `foo` within the `OpsCenter` keyspace, then it would look like `OpsCenter.foo`

## update-keyspace.py
This is a quick example on how to update the `strategy_class` for a given keyspace
* In production you only ever want to use `NetworkTopologyStrategy`
* Also, you may want to add another datacenter and do less that what I have listed; fit it for your use
* In the example, I have created an array of keyspaces that I want to all be updated. You will notice `"strategy_options": {"onprem" : "3", "AWS" : "3", "Azure" : "3", "GCP" : "3"}`
* I want to have the keyspaces updated to be on four datacenters in total, their names are: onprem, AWS, Azure, and GCP
* I want three replicas of the data in each of the four data opscenter_session
* The code will iterate through the `keyspaces` array and update each keyspace as described above

There you go! Some quick and dirty API examples. For some more advanced examples, checkout one of my other repos which uses the OpsCenter API to setup a multi-cloud DSE cluster: https://github.com/justinbreese/dse-multi-cloud-demo/setup.py
